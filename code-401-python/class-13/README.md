# Serverless Functions

Serverless is a cloud computing application development and execution model that enables developers to build and run application code without provisioning or managing servers or backend infrastructure.

Serverless lets developers put all their focus into writing the best front-end application code and business logic they can. All developers need to do is write their application code and deploy it to containers managed by a cloud service provider. The cloud provider handles the rest, provisioning the cloud infrastructure required to run the code and scaling the infrastructure up and down on demand as needed. The cloud provider is also responsible for all routine infrastructure management and maintenance such as operating system updates and patches, security management, capacity planning, system monitoring and more.

> **Serverless does not mean 'no servers'**

'Serverless' describes the developer’s experience with those servers—they are are invisible to the developer, who doesn't see them, manage them, or interact with them in any way.


**Serverless is more than just FaaS**: Function-as-a-service, or FaaS, is a cloud computing service that enables developers to run code or containers in response to specific events or requests, without specifying or managing the infrastructure required to run to code.

**Pros and cons of serverless**

1. **Pros**

    - Improved developer productivity

    - Pay for execution only

    - Develop in any language

    - Streamlined development/DevOps cycles

    - Cost-effective performance

    - Usage visibility

2. **Cons**

    - Unacceptable latency for certain applications

    - Higher costs for stable or predictable workloads

    - Monitoring and debugging issues

    - Vendor lock-in

**Use cases for serverless**

- Serverless and microservices

- API backends

- Data processing

- Massively parallel compute/“Map” operations

- Stream processing workloads
