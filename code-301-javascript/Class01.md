**What is a  _"component"_?**

A component is a software object, intended to interact with other software objects "components"., each perform a specific action and it is reusable.

**What are the characteristics of a  _"component"_?**

- **Reusable**; it is like initializing one button for example and be able to use it in multiple places instead of initializing multiple buttons.

- **Replaceable**; may be freely substituted with other similar components.

- **Not context specific**; designed to operate in different environments and contexts.

- **Extensible**; can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior, for example, a prompt, its context can be different from the original component.

- **Encapsulated**; it allows its functionality to be used without exposing its internal processes, variables or state.

- **Independent**; it can operate as a standalone object.

**What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?**

- **Ease of deployment**; easier to replace existing versions with no impact on the other components or the system as a whole.

- **Reduced cost**; The use of third-party components allows you to spread the cost of development and maintenance.

- **Ease of development**; Components implement well-known interfaces to provide defined functionality, allowing development without impacting other parts of the system.

- **Reusable**; The use of reusable components means that they can be used to spread the development and maintenance cost across several applications or systems.

- **Modification of technical complexity**; A component modifies the complexity through the use of a component container and its services.

- **Reliability**; The overall system reliability increases since the reliability of each individual component enhances the reliability of the whole system via reuse.

- **System maintenance and evolution**; Easy to change and update the implementation without affecting the rest of the system.

- **Independent**; Independency and flexible connectivity of components. Independent development of components by different group in parallel. Productivity for the software development and future software development.

**What is "_props"_ short for?**

**"Props"** is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.

**How are _"props"_ used in React?**

1. Define an attribute and its value(data).
2. Pass it to child component(s) by using Props.
3. Render the Props Data.

**What is the flow of _props_?**

Data with props are being passed in a uni-directional flow (one way from parent to child). Furthermore, props data is read-only, which means that data coming from the parent should not be changed by child components.
