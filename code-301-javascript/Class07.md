# REST

> One side of programming is connecting people together, well using APIs can do it and we don't need to reinvent the wheel that's why it is important to get to know how to send, get, update and delete data.

**Who is Roy Fielding?**

A programmer who helped in writing the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.

**Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?**

Because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines.

**What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?**

Is a HTTP requests which basically means applying nouns and verbs, like, when we need to get the data. The data is nouns and the action of bringing it back is verb, and this is GET request. Same concept applys on POST, DELETE and PUT.

**What does a GET do?**

It fetchs the data and bring it to the web page to display the content.

**What does a POST do?**

It is the opposite of GET, instead of getting the data, it holds our data and pass it to the API/server for example and asks it to store it.

**What does PUT do?**

It is used to update current data that the API/server for example have it.

**What does PATCH do?**

It is similar to the PUT but it applies partial modifications.
