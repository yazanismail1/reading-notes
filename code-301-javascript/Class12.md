**In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents:**

**100's =** The request is recieved and the rerver will try to complete the request.

**200's =** It means that the request is succesfully completed.

**300's =** It tells the client that the resource they are requesting isnâ€™t available at the expected location anymore.

**400's =** Invalid requests

**500's =** Error from the server side.

**What is a status code 202?**

This code tells the client that the request was valid, but its processing will finish sometime in the future.

**
What is a status code 308?**

This tells the client to use another URL to access the resource and not use the current URL anymore.

**What code would you use if an update didn't return data to a client?**

204 or 404

**What code would you use if a resource used to exist but no longer does?**

409

**What is the 'Forbidden' status code?**

4.3

**Why do we need to pull our MongoDB database string out of our server and put it into our .env?**

To be hidden so that other people don't use it and when deploying the service can change the path easy.

**What is middleware?**

Is software that lies between an operating system and the applications running on it. Essentially functioning as hidden translation layer, middleware enables communication and data management for distributed applications.

**What does app.use(express.json()) do?**

It parses incoming JSON requests and puts the parsed data in req.

**What does the /:id mean in a route?**

it's a dynamic route, so req.params.id will be whatever comes after summary/ in that specific request.

**What is the difference between PUT and PATCH?**

PUT is a method of modifying resource where the client sends data that updates the entire resource . PATCH is a method of modifying resources where the client sends partial data that is to be updated without modifying the entire data.

**How do you make a default value in a schema?**

Your schemas can define default values for certain paths. If you create a new document without that path set, the default will kick in.

**What does a 500 error status code mean?**

Is a generic error response. It means that the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.

**What is the difference between a status 200 and a status 201?**

The 200 status code is by far the most common returned. It means, simply, that the request was received and understood and is being processed. A 201 status code indicates that a request was successful and as a result, a resource has been created.
